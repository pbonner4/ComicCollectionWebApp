# ComicCollectionWebApp

An application for comic book fans to register for an account, create personal comic book collections to display, share with there friends, and mark collctions public for the whole platform to look at.

# Project Status
Largeley complete but I will return to add features such as saving comics from public collections to your own "save for later" collection, a "like" system, share comics with friends functionality etc.

I am working on other projects as well so the timeline is "to be determined."

### Tech Used: ###
- Java, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, SQL, PostgreSQL, Vue.js.

# Video Demonstration

## Registration/Sales Page: ##
- Ability to toggle between a light-mode and dark-mode - two completely different Designs, wait until the scroll to the bottom to see.
- CSS animations for heros to pop in on scroll.
- Lists Main Selling Points
- Button sends users straight back to the top in order to register and make an account.

## User's Personal Dashboard: ##
- Keep track of the amount of collections you have
- Initially there is only 1 search bar in order to easily find the collection you are looking for.
- Upon Clicking a collection, a second search appears to allow a user to search through the comics within the clicked collection.
- The info check mark at the bottom of each comic allows for a summary of the comic to render on the left navigation bar, if one's available.
- Towards the end of the gif I display how the comics will look depending on which user display (Light vs Dark) is clicked.

## Public Collections Page: ##
- This page is for all of the collections that were marked public by users throughout the system, unathorized visitors may view this page.
- Works essentially the same way as the user dashboard, except theres links to login and register.
- For example, as a unauthorized vistior and comic book fan, I may see a public collection of Doctor Strange Comics and want to learn more, save it to my own collection etc., but cant do any of that until I register - which is where the main "selling" come in on the register page.
- An authorized user would make a collection public in order to show it off, or share it publicly for other comic fans to mayb learn more and become more interested in their comics.

## Add A Collection, or Add More to Existing Collection ##
- A user will always be able to add a new collection, and then immediately be redirected to add comics to it.
- A user will always to be able to add whichever comics they would like to an existing or new collection.
- Supports the ability to search multiple queries, and add however many they would like at any given time.
